// :page-aliases: 4.3@mule-runtime::dataweave-cookbook-output-a-field-when-present.adoc

This DataWeave example outputs a field if it is present in the input, a JSON array. The first object in the array contains `"insurance"`, while the second does not. The XML output mirrors this structure.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The example uses these functions:

* `map` to go through every element within the input array.
* `if($.insurance?)` to determine when to output an `insurance` field.
