Anypoint DataMapper allows you to map an interface or abstract class as a POJO. *Binding*, in this case, refers to linking your POJO (which can be an interface or abstract class) to a concrete class. Thus, when instantiating your POJO, Mule uses the concrete class you specified.

**Factory classes **allow you to delegate object construction to another class. In this case, your factory class must have a static method called `create`, that returns the object you want to instantiate.

== Assumptions

This document assumes the reader is familiar with the Anypoint DataMapper Transformer. Consult the xref:6.x@studio::datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper User Guide and Reference] document for details. For a listing of all available tools in DataMapper, consult xref:5.x@studio::datamapper-visual-reference.adoc[DataMapper Visual Reference].

== Setting POJO Binding and Factory Definitions

. To specify bindings and factories, open the *Properties* dialog by clicking the cog icon (highlighted below) in the Output mapping pane of the DataMapper view. The Properties icon displays the output *Pojo Properties* window (below, bottom).

. Click *Binding Definition* or **Factory Definition **to add, remove or edit binding or factory properties.
. Uncheck the *Cache Data in Memory* checkbox if you want DataMapper to cache process data to disk instead of in memory.
. Click *OK* to save your changes.
