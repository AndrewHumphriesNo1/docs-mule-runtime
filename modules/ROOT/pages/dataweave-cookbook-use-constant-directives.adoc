This DataWeave example builds URLs from constants that are defined as variables (`var`) in the DataWeave header. It also conditionally outputs fields if they are present in the input.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The example uses these functions:

* `++` (concatenate) to build constant directives into URLs.
* `map` to go through the fields in the input.
* `if` to output `summary` and `brand` fields.
