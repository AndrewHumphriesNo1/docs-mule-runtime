MuleSoft makes available trial versions of its Enterprise Edition runtime for the purpose of evaluation. Though perfect for exploring the myriad uses of Mule, Anypoint Studio, and Mule Management Console, the trial license for Enterprise limits usage of the runtime. Complete the following steps to acquire and install an *Enterprise license*, then begin using Mule runtime in a production environment.

. mailto:info@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] to acquire an *Enterprise license* in the form of a `license.lic` file.
. Before installing, it's recommended to remove the previous License from your `$MULE_HOME` directory. To do so, navigate to `$MULE_HOME/conf/` and delete the existing `muleLicenseKey.lic` file.
. If you are installing your license on multiple platforms, back up your new `license.lic` file in another location before proceeding.
. Make sure that the Mule Server is *stopped (not running)* and then open the terminal or command line on your system.
. On *Mac/Unix/Linux*, from the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory, run the following command:
+
`mule -installLicense ~/license.lic` +
 +
On *Windows*, first copy the `license.lic` file into the \bin folder, then execute the following in the command line: +
 +
`mule -installLicense license.lic `
. In the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory, Mule saves a new file called `muleLicenseKey.lic`. This shows that the license has been installed.
. *Start* your Mule Server again, by the usual means.
