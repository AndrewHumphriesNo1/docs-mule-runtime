This DataWeave example takes in a set of item prices and stock amounts and uses
several functions to calculate subtotals, deduct discounts and add taxes.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

It makes use of the following:

* `map` function to go through all the items in the input.
* basic math operations like `*`, `+` and `-`.
* String concatenation with `++`.
* `as` to force string values into numbers.
* Fixed values in the header to set tax and discount amounts.
* A custom function in the header, to define once and use multiple times in the code.
* `reduce` function to aggregate the various items into a total.
