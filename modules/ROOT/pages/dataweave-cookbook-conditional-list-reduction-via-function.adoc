// :page-aliases: 4.3@mule-runtime::dataweave-cookbook-conditional-list-reduction-via-function.adoc

This DataWeave example flattens the input to something simpler. For each element
in the input, it conditionally includes a `contentTypes` field only in case it
has any values. It then rearranges this content into a more readable shape.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The examples use these functions:

* `map` to go through every element in the input array.
* `reduce` to aggregate the multiple elements in the `tags` array into one field.
* `splitBy` to parse the values in the "tags" array, so as to only select the first part of each string (through `[0]`) and discard the second.
* `++` to concatenate these elements into one single string, with commas as separators.
* `if` include the last field only if the `contentTypes` array is bigger than 0.
