The following DataWeave examples show how to convert a file stream into Base64 and to convert a Base64 string into a file stream. They use a PDF file as the input and output.

== Encode a PDF File to Base64

This example performs Base64 encoding on a PDF file. It simulates the transformation in the Read operation from the <<xml_config, XML configuration>> by converting a Base64 file stream (`application/octet-stream`) to Binary and outputting the Binary in the `text/plain` format.

The example uses the following functions:

* `toBase64` from the `dw::core::Binaries` module to transform a binary value to a Base64 string.
*  `readUrl` from the `Core (dw::Core)` module to input a PDF file.
+
The example assumes that the PDF file is in the `src/main/resources` directory of a Mule project in Anypoint Studio. It provides the name of the PDF file and specifies the MIME type as `"application/octet-stream"`. Using `"binary"` as the second `readUrl` argument is also valid for this example.

//NOTE that we can't yet automate this example. Outputs text format.
//Need to check if PDF input is supported by validator.

== Decode Base64

This example simulates the transformation in the Write operation from the <<xml_config, XML configuration>> by converting a Base64 file stream (`application/octet-stream`) to Binary and outputting the Binary in the `application/PDF with binary` format. The example does not generate a PDF file; a Write operation is required to generate such a file.

The examples use the following functions:

* `fromBase64` in the `dw::core::Binaries` module to transform a Base64 string to a binary value.
* `readUrl` to input a PDF file.
+
The example assumes that the PDF file is in the `src/main/resources` directory of a Mule project in Anypoint Studio. The function reads the input PDF as an octet-stream MIME type. Using the MIME type `"binary"` as the second `readUrl` argument is also valid for this example.

//NOTE that we can't yet automate this example. Outputs text format.
//Need to check if PDF input is supported by validator.

var myPDFasBinary = toBase64(myPDF as Binary)
output application/PDF with binary
---
fromBase64(myPDFasBinary as String) as Binary
----

The output is the text representation of the PDF.

== XML Configuration Example

In Anypoint Studio, you can create and run a Mule flow that encodes and decodes a PDF file. After you complete the procedure, the example reads the file from the specified local directory using the File Connector Read operation. It writes the PDF to the specified directory by using the File Connector Write operation, and it uses Transform Message components to encode the file to Base64 and to decode that output from Base64.

. Create a Mule project in Anypoint Studio:
.. Select *File > New > Mule Project*.
.. Enter a name for your Mule project.
.. Click *Finish*.
. Use *Add Module* in the Mule Palette to add the File Connector:
.. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
.. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `file` in the search field.
.. Click *File Connector* in Available modules.
.. Click *Add*.
.. Click *Finish*.
. In the Studio canvas, navigate to the *Configuration XML* tab.
. Copy and paste the following example between the `<mule/>` elements of a Mule flow in Anypoint Studio:

Note that it is valid to replace the directive `output application/pdf with binary` in the second Transform Message component with `output application/octet-stream`.
+
. Place a PDF file of your choice into a local directory on your machine.
. Correct the input and output directories of the *Read* and *Write* operations:
+
* In the *Read* operation, change the *File Path* value `/Users/me/Downloads" to the location of your PDF file.
* In the *Write* operation, change the *Path* value `/Users/me/pdf-test.pdf"` to the location and file name that you want to output the file.
. Run the project in Studio.
. Load the `0.0.0.0:8081/transform` into a browser.
+
This action creates a PDF file in the specified location and generates a separate `transform` file with the message in the Set Payload component, `PDF file created in the directory specified in the Write operation.`
