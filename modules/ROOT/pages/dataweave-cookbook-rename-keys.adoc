This DataWeave example renames some keys in a JSON object, while retaining the names of all others in the output.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The example uses these functions:

* `mapObject` to go through the `key:value` pairs in a JSON object.
* `if` by itself to determine when to change the name of a key.
* `if` with `and` to retain the name of all keys except the two with new names.
* `as` to coerce the type of the keys into a String.

A more maintainable way to produce the same output uses DataWeave pattern matching.

The example uses the following functions and statements:

* `mapObject` to go through the `key:value` pairs in a JSON object.
* `match` on each key in the input.
* `case` statements to change the name of matching keys in the input.
* `else` statement to retain the name of keys that do not require a name change.
