The DataWeave examples merge fields from separate input arrays. The first (`firstInput`) is a DataWeave variable that lists price by book ID, and the second (`secondInput`) lists authors by book ID. Each book has a unique `bookId` key.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The DataWeave scripts produce the same output. Both scripts use two `map` functions with a filter, and one of them also creates an alias for the `bookId`:

* The first `map` function iterates over the elements of the `firstInput`
array. As the function evaluates each element, a second `map` function uses a filter to identify any elements in the second array (`secondInput`) that match the `filter` criteria (`secondInput filter ($.*bookId contains firstInputValue.bookId)`). The filter returns an element from `secondInput` that contains a `bookId` value that matches the `bookId` value in the `firstInput` element.
* The second `map` function evaluates that filtered element and then uses `secondInputValue.author` to select and populate the value of its `"author"` field in the object `{author : secondInputValue.author}`.
* `filter` limits the scope of the second `map` function to objects in the `secondInput` that share the same `bookId`.

As the next script shows, you can also write the same script using an `id` alias (created with `using (id = firstInputValue.bookId)`). The alias replaces the  selector expression, `firstInputValue.bookId`, which is longer.
