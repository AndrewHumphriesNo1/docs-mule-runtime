DataWeave is a programming language designed by MuleSoft for accessing and transforming
data that travels through a Mule application. Mule runtime engine incorporates DataWeave in several core components like Transform and Set Payload, which enable you to execute DataWeave scripts and expressions in your Mule app.

DataWeave scripts act on data in the Mule event. Most commonly, you use it to
access and transform data in the message payload. For example, after a component
in your Mule app retrieves data from one system, you can use DataWeave to modify and
output selected fields in that data to a new data format, then use another
component in your app to pass on that data to another system.
